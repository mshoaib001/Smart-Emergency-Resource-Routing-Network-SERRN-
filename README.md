**Overview**
Smart Emergency Resource Routing Network (SERRN) is a fault-tolerant network infrastructure designed to ensure reliable communication between emergency services (ambulance, rescue teams, fire brigade) and hospitals. The system provides secure, high-availability, and zero-downtime connectivity with automatic backup routing during network failures.

**Objectives**
Ensure uninterrupted communication for emergency services
Implement network redundancy using HSRP
Improve security using VLAN segmentation
Increase bandwidth and performance with EtherChannel
Enable automatic IP assignment using DHCP

**Technologies used**
Cisco Packet Tracer
HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)
VLANs (Network Segmentation)
EtherChannel
DHCP
Layer 2 Switching & Routing

**System Architecture**
Mobile emergency units connected via Wireless Access Points
Layer 2 switches for traffic management
Main and Backup routers for redundancy
Hospital server and control system integration

**Features**
Automatic failover and backup routing
Secure network segmentation
High bandwidth data transmission
Real-time communication support
Zero downtime network design

**Future Improvements**
IoT-based patient monitoring integration
AI-based traffic and route optimization
